### My name is Brandy Rimes and I am a future software engineer in the making ðŸ‘‹

Hello World! Our very first sentence we run in any new language us devs learn. My journey began as a curious teenager who took computer science in high school as a way to get out of having to take pre-cal for my math credit. Three years later and I would be completing Computer Science III and competing in code wars after school. I always wanted to end up in computers but I was unsure of just which area was quite my forte. When I found Lambda in 2019 I assumed I would be able to just pick up where I had left off in 2014. Much to my dismay, I was very much out of my element and for the first time in a long time struggled to complete the very thing I loved while still working full time. However in the fall of 2020 I completed the full stack course and would later go on to complete the computer science portion with much more ease than React and Back End.

I am an aspiring software engineer that day by day realizes there is always new things to learn! My late mentor had one of the most brilliant programming minds I have ever known. Thinking outside of the box or even backwards was something he always told us to implement with new algorithms or even real world solutions. In our rapily growing tech world I believe that is just what we need to contniue creating and building new platforms whilst imporving the platforms we have now is to not be afraid to think outside of the box or even completely turn the box inside out to get the job done. As Mr Eddison says, "I've not failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

Programming is all about never giving up. We find bugs to fix to then unveil 10 new bugs hidden behind the one small bug. Once we have perfected those we move on to either upgrade and release new versions or begin new projects all together and do it all over again. Feel free to connect with me as I navigate this ever-changing ocean of new languages to become a stronger software engineer then I am today.
